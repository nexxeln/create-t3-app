# What is TailwindCSS?

TailwindCSS is a tiny, [utility first](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) CSS framework for building custom designs, while being able to switch your brain off. Its usage along with React components is extremely powerful for quickly building UIs.

TailwindCSS has a beautiful built-in design system, that comes out of the box with a carefully chosen color palette, sizing patterns for styles such as width/height and padding/margin for a uniform design, as well as media breakpoints for an encouraged mobile-first layout. This can be extended and customised to be as restrictive or broad as you like.
