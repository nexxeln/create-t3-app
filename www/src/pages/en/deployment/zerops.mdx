Zerops is a bare metal cloud platform as a service (Paas) with a developer-first approach. See
[`Nermalcat69/T3-Zerops`](https://github.com/nermalcat69/t3-zerops/) for an example repo based on
this doc.

## Why Host on Zerops

There are a lot of pros and cons when choosing a deployment provider, but Zerops has many advantages,
such as being one of the cheapest options in the market. However, you won't get a free tier like with
Vercel. While Vercel offers more features, the difference may not be significant for many use cases.

Deploying on Zerops is a good move because it is economically viable, considering it's a bare metal
infrastructure, and gives you more control similar. Additionally, Zerops provides one
of the cheapest PostgreSQL databases in the market. If you're looking for a free tier you can consider
Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or Deno Deploy.
